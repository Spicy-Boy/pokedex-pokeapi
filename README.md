# pokedex-pokeapi
 Practicing API calls with this custom Pokedex website!

*API: https://pokeapi.co/*

NOTE: I would like to transform the dex entries into static html pages rather than the current dynamically generated entries from the api. This saves electricity and time for everybody in the long run.
